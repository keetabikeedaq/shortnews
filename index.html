The company is launching an AI-powered text-to-speech feature in partnership with Speechify that will allow Artifact users to listen to news articles read aloud.</p>

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">Twitter has removed the iconic bird logo and adopted ‘X’ as its official logo. This move comes after Elon Musk announced the change over the weekend. The change is already live on the website.

Notably, Musk tweeted that x.com now also redirects to twitter.com. In the post, Musk also called this an “interim” logo, so we might see another logo change in the future.</p>

<p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">The social network might not stop at just replacing the logo. Musk said the company will eventually “bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds.”

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">After Twitter’s (now X) rollout of a new paid plan offering verification, other social media companies like Meta, LinkedIn, and Tumblr have tried to implement their own badges. Reddit is now joining the bandwagon by testing a new “official” badge.

The company said it is testing these labels with a small set of profiles as proof of authenticity. The label appears like a flair next to the username.</p>
