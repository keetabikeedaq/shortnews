      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">The way artificial intelligence can write software has already prompted many companies to introduce code-generating products, so it‚Äôs no surprise that SettleMint, a low-code blockchain programming tool for enterprises, recently added an AI assistant to its platform.

The AI assistant, which arrived about nine months after SettleMint announced its 16 million euro Series A funding round, promises to help developers create smart contracts, integrate data, and enhance quality assurance (QA) testing</p>

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">Elon Musk-owned X, the company formerly known as Twitter, is streamlining its crowdsourced fact-checking feature Community Notes. The feature historically has provided information to users about why they were seeing a fact check appended to a tweet, er, post. Now, after three years of development, the company says this extra context will be removed for those who are already experienced with Community Notes.
