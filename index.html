      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">After weeks of changes to its social handles, branding on its interface, a redirect on the web, and lots of chatter from its owner, Twitter the app has finally changed its name on the App Store to X. The single-letter name may have an exception: Apple typically doesn’t allow developers name their apps as a single character.

Last week, Twitter rebranded its iOS and Android apps, replacing the old bird logo, and screenshots in the App Store, with the new ‘X’ logo. However, the company wasn’t able to change its actual listed name on the App Store</p>

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">Earlier this month, Twitter — which has since rebranded as X — began sharing ad revenue with verified creators in an attempt to retain top talent on its platform. Today, the company announced its “Ads Revenue Sharing” program is now available for eligible creators globally. The program, according to posts by X owner Elon Musk, aims to dole out $5 million in the first round of creator payments. This would be cumulative from the month of February onward, he noted.

Several creators posted they had received substantial payouts as a result, with some ranging in the five to six figures</p>

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">Microsoft is making it a lot more convenient to use multiple high refresh rate monitors with Windows 11.
