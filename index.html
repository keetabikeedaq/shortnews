  <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">Privacy-focused search engine and browser maker Brave is taking another step away from its reliance on other search providers with today’s news that it has now launched its own image and video search engine. That means users will no longer have to leave Brave when they want either image or video search results, as the results will now be served directly from Brave Search’s own independent index, the company explains

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">Triller has long teased its ambitions to go public, and now, the short-form video platform seems to on its way to an IPO. Triller filed an S-1 on Wednesday, seeking to directly list on the New York Stock Exchange.

The TikTok competitor previously tried to go public via SPAC in a $5 billion merger with SeaChange International, which was later scrapped; it also attempted a direct listing last year, which also didn’t seem to be successful.</p>

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">GitHub Copilot has changed how developers write their code.

In 2022, GitHub launched a feature that allowed users to block suggestions of matching public code automatically. </p>

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">
 First, rather than being able to send an unlimited number of DM requests to someone who doesn’t follow you, you will now only be able to send them one message.
 Second, DM invites are now limited to text only, which means you can only send images, videos or voice notes to someone who doesn’t follow you after they’ve accepted your request to chat</p>

“We believe that we can make good design more democratic and impact more people,” Pei says in the video.</p>

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">TRussian state-sponsored hackers posed as technical support staff on Microsoft Teams to compromise dozens of global organizations, including government agencies.

Microsoft security researchers said on Wednesday that the “highly targeted” social engineering campaign was carried out by a Russian state-sponsored hacking group tracked by Microsoft as “Midnight Blizzard,” but more commonly known as APT29 or Cozy Bear. The group, which was linked to the infamous SolarWinds attack in 2020, is part of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR.</p>

 Twitter, or X as it’s currently being rebranded, now has live broadcasts again.
