  <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;"> Elon Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter, is planning to roll out a new way to display news links without any headline or description. The social network will display just the link and the header image in a post, according to a report by Fortune.

Musk confirmed the move in a post on Monday and said it was coming “directly” from him. The change would “greatly improve the aesthetics,” he said.

</h3>
  
      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">

As of today, we’ve learned from those testing that there is no dark theme to be found; be it automatic with the system or a manual setting. You just get a light theme that doesn’t look to be an entirely white, but rather gray. The bottom bar and FAB is tinted a light turquoise, rather than adopting Dynamic Color.  </p>
