  <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">Kenya was one of the first countries where Worldcoin — the controversial startup that aims to create a new “human identity and financial network” through eye scans and its own cryptocurrency — launched sign-ups and as of this week, it was one of the biggest markets for take-up. Now, Kenya could be one of the first to ban it outright.

The country’s Ministry of the Interior has issued a decree suspending Worldcoin enrollment in the country, citing concerns with the “authenticity and legality” of its activities in the areas of security, financial services and data protection</p>

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">Social media company X, formerly Twitter, now lets paid users hide their verification checkmarks. The Elon Musk-owned company introduced paid verification last year with the Twitter Blue relaunch. The service was renamed to XBlue during the ongoing rebranding exercise.

The company has updated the help page for paid subscriptions, which is titled ‘About Twitter Blue’, saying that even if you hide the checkmark it might be visible in some places.</p>

The new Tinder membership was confirmed earlier this year by Tinder CPO Mark Van Ryswyk, who had then dubbed the $500-per-month offering “Tinder Vault” in an interview with Fast Company</p>

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">As competition with TikTok and Instagram Reels heats up, YouTube today announced an expanded suite of creation tools for its own short-form video platform, YouTube Shorts. Among the new features are tools for remixing, adding effects, stickers, going live and others aimed at encouraging inspiration. The company is also starting a test of a new mobile-first vertical live experience that will help live creators get discovered in the main Shorts feed.
 But many parents complain the addictive nature of these platforms, due to their infinite scroll algorithm using AI</p>

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">Amazon is expanding its Amazon Clinic virtual healthcare marketplace to all customers nationwide. The online retail giant announced today that customers in all 50 states and Washington, DC will be able to easily access licensed clinicians via video visits for more than 30 common health concerns, such as pink eye and urinary tract infections.

Amazon Clinic launched in November 2022 as a way to connect users with healthcare providers. Amazon Clinic does not provide the healthcare services itself and instead supplies a platform to connect telemedicine partners with users.</p>

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">Instagram appears to be working on new notices that would identify when AI has played a role in creating content on its platform. 

App researcher Alessandro Paluzzi, who frequently discovers new Instagram features before they’re officially announced or released, has posted a screenshot of a page in the Instagram app that reads “the creator or Meta said that this content was created or edited with AI.</p>

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">After a few months of testing the feature, Microsoft has widely rolled out spatial audio for its Teams desktop app on Windows and macOS. Similar to what Apple has done with FaceTime, Microsoft’s implementation of spatial audio makes it so that voices of everyone on a call sound like they’re more spread out, with each person having a distinct position based on where they are on screen.</p>

This comes just a few months after Microsoft opened up a preview of the Loop experience so everyone can enjoy the company's take on Notion, another popular connected workplace solution.</p>
