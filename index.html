  <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;"> X- (previously Twitter) and Threads-rival Bluesky has started allowing users to self-tag their posts so they can be automatically filtered.

The company has started with NSFW categories, through which, users can tag a post with content warning categories such as “Suggestive,” “Nudity,” or “Porn.” The social network said users can tap the shield icon in the composer window to select the tag. Self-tagging will expand categories of labels over time, the company said in a post.

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">OpenAI claims that it’s developed a way to use GPT-4, its flagship generative AI model, for content moderation — lightening the burden on human teams.

Detailed in a post published to the official OpenAI blog, the technique relies on prompting GPT-4 with a policy that guides the model in making moderation judgments and creating a test set of content examples that might or might not violate the policy. </p>

<h3>Apple moved the end call button again in iOS 17</h3>
<p>Apple has moved end call button once again with the latest iOS 17 developer beta. Now, it lives in the lower middle of the call screen instead of on the lower right. It’s a little change, but it might mean that iOS 17’s new call controls won’t feel quite as different once Apple officially rolls out the new software sometime this fall. </h6>
