  <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">Disney is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its streaming services, following similar move from Netflix that kicked off a few months ago.

The company’s CEO Bob Iger said that password sharing among Disney Plus has been “significant,” and as such it is “actively exploring” methods to control it.

“We already have the technical capability to monitor much of this [password sharing].

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">Electronic signature has become table stakes for companies involved in document storage and management. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Google announced an open beta of its new-ish eSignature capability in Google Workspace today. The new feature will be available specifically for Google Docs and Google Drive for individual and various group accounts. </p>

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">Like most software, Slack developed over time adding a slew of new features like Huddles, Canvas and workflows. But like any piece of software that is over a decade old with all of those new pieces, it makes sense to revisit old design decisions, especially in the context of being an enterprise communications tool that is now part of the Salesforce ecosystem. </p>

</h3>
  
      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">The upper house of India’s parliament greenlit the country’s first data protection act on Wednesday, facing no resistance as opposition leaders opted out of participation. The bill — which is set to become law once it receives approval from the President of India, which is highly probable as it’s just a formality — grants the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government greater control over how tech companies process users’ data.

<h3>You’ll be able to run Windows XP on your Apple Vision Pro from day one</h3>
<p>Apple Vision Pro was announced in June at WWDC 2023, and the product won’t hit stores until 2024. However, in the meantime, Apple has released the visionOS SDK so that developers can build and test Apple Vision Pro apps on a Mac before the official launch. And surprisingly, someone managed to port a Windows XP virtual machine to visionOS. </p>
