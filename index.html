      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">SpaceX conducted a full-pressure test of a new water deluge system for its Starship launch vehicle on Friday, as the company looks to resolve one of the biggest problems that cropped up during the orbital flight test in April.

It’s a major step toward making the launch infrastructure ready to support a second test flight of the world’s most powerful rocket. During the previous test flight, the heat and energy from the Super Heavy booster’s 33 Raptor engines cratered the launch pad and generated chunks of concrete that badly damaged the orbital launch mount.</p>

      <p style="padding:15px;margin:10px;text-align:justify;">Google is experimenting with the use of AI to auto-generate YouTube video summaries, according to a notice on a support page dated July 31st. The page, which we spotted via Android Police, notes that these summaries will only appear next to a limited number of English-language videos, and will only be viewable by a limited number of users. They’ll appear on YouTube’s watch and search pages, and are intended to give a brief overview of a video’s contents without replacing its existing description written by a human.</p>
